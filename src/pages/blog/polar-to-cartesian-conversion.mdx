## The Problem

Often times when working in a 2D display framework you want to display things in a circular pattern.
However you find yourself unable to because you don't know what magical combination of
x and y will find you along the circles edge, curses to the cartesian lords.

## A Solution

Hail be the wonderful forces of pre-calculus teachers the world over. Polar coordinates are what we want!
They allow us to define an angle and a radius to identify a point in 2D space, rather than x and y.

But how do we use this wonderful coordinate system on a webpage?\
Wellllll, that's the catch. You can't directly. However all of the tools necessary to
convert from Polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates are available in native javascript.

The only tools needed for the conversion are `Math.cos()`, `Math.sin()` and a circle constant, which is a
whole discussion I'd be willing to have, but we don't have `Math.TAU` yet, so at the top of our file
we will use `Math.TAU = 2*Math.PI` as it makes our equations cleaner. [Tau manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)

For any polar coordinate where `r = radius` and `theta = angle` then we can convert to cartesian as simply
as;

```js
let x = r * Math.cos(theta);
let y = r * Math.sin(theta);
```

## Example

Lets say we want to get the center positions of 20 circles arranged in a circle about 0, 0. As seen in the [p5](https://p5js.org/) sketch seen below.

<Circles />

All we need to do is divide the number of radians in a circle by 20, to get the angle at each increment evenly spaced apart.
Then loop through those increments and draw circles.

```js
Math.TAU = 2*Math.PI // Math.TAU makes our code a hair cleaner,
                     // and I am astonished its not a language feature yet

let n = 20;   // Number of circles
let r = 100;  // 100px radius
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  let theta = (Math.TAU / n) * i;
  let x = r * Math.cos(theta);
  let y = r * Math.sin(theta);

  drawCircle(x, y); // Assuming this is your method
                    // for drawing a circle at position x, y
}
```

## Conclusion

Polar coordinates are a powerful tool for converting from Polar coordinates radius and angle to cartesian coordinates x
and y

<SinCos />
Not a perfect visualization, but the angle of the black line is `Î˜` and the radius is 1
