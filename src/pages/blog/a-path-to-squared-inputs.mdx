## Hey programmer, the robot is hard to control

Complaint where the linear input maps poorly with
the dc motor curves

### Permanent-Magnet DC Motors

[wpilib glossary term](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/frc-glossary.html#term-permanent-magnet-DC-motor)
[wpilib arm tuning](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-feedforward.html#the-permanent-magnet-dc-motor-feedforward-equation)

Show on the Rev Neo data sheet how due to how DC motors work (DC Motor equations?),
the majority of your robots power output exists in the center of your range

```html
<!-- TODO: Show Rev Neo power curves -->
```

segway into mapping inputs onto that range

## What do I mean by Input mapping?

explain with a piecewise function how we could allow for finer control in our
optimal power range, and lead into the `f(x) = x^2` function as a quick and
simple map that gives reasonable control in the low to mid range, with
sacrifice granularity in the upper range of inputs

### Basic robust squared inputs for diff drive

Show the most basic implementation of a squared inputs in the context of a
WPILib DifferentialDrive, then compare to the actual DifferentialDrive
implementation in WPILibj

```

## And then there was swerve

As frc has evolved, so have our drive systems. Modern frc has settled largely
on two predominant platforms, skid steer/WCD, and Swerve drive thanks to the
advent of COTS swerve modules

While once swerve was a mere idea, suddenly it was on a robot and needed to be
programmed. As this isn't a swerve programming post (A project for another
day), I will skip the implementation of a swerve drive, and
instead look merely at how we control it.

### Our new Axis!

When controlling a Tank Drive robot, you have only 2 axes, forward and rotation.
However with a Swerve Drive robot, there is an additional axis. We have to
control forward, sideways, and rotation.

The gamepad control scheme my team went with, and I'd guess nearly every gamepad
team uses, uses the left joystick to represent the translation axes (forward and
sideways) and the right joysticks horizontal movement representing rotation.

You may have noticed this layout is just Arcade drive, but we also include the
horizontal axis of the left joystick. This proved rather convenient for learning
to drive Swerve drive.

### Don't forget about our dearest squared inputs

And of course mere moments after testing our first working swerve
implementation,

## The problem

explaining the symptoms, namely the inconsistent drive speed

### ? Debugging steps

Walk through the joystick circle test we performed at comp, and why that means
need to review what our previous implementation actually does

### What does our implementation actually do?

We sorta didn't verify that our naive implementation does what we expect it to
do, so let's visualize it

```html
<!-- TODO: Visualize the naive implementation -->
```

#### What did we want it to do?

Talk about maintaining the vector's angle, but scale its magnitude

### Our first solution!

As with all good problems, you should first take one big step back and
determine if pursuing the thing that is causing you problems is worth the
hassle at all.

So obviously we can just turn off the input squaring! No squaring of the
inputs, no problems. Our speed problems are fixed, we are actually taking full
advantage of our drive train, and are ready to compete to our maximum!

Alas, once the driver hears of this change, they will of course be saddened by
the loss of the oh so nice squared inputs. And whilst our programmers soul has
long since suffered heavy jpeg compression, it nonetheless cannot do to be
receiving puppy dog eyes from the driver. We've got to find a real solution...

### A closer look at DifferentialDrive

#### What was it doing in diff drive?

#### What does that look like with our additional axis?

### The polar approach

- Cartesion -> Polar
  - Potentially a subheading about atan2, a programming thing that math people
    may not know about
- Scale magnitude
- Polar -> Cartesion

I need to research (read: ask on math sub) if there is a more computationally
effecient method of achieving this

I'd really hate for this to be the final result of this write up

talk about its computation costs and maybe other drawbacks
