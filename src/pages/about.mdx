import Toolbox from "@components/about/Toolbox.astro";

I am software engineer who loves a good bug hunt, a daunting puzzle, and clever
solutions to problems. I enjoy getting to work with others and experience how
they see the world, as well as how they tackle problems. Feel free to share
some cool snippets or fun projects with me!

I am largely experienced in React and Node, however I have dabbled in django
backends and even a bit of Rust. I do wish to further explore lower level
applications to further my toolbelt. I know a little bit of C++ and have begun
learning Rust, but I haven't had the chance to work on any larger projects
built with these :P

While very comfortable in Linux, Windows, and Mac dev environments, I generally
prefer working in a Unix environments like Linux or Mac.

Alright, time for the fun stuff

Maybe one of these days I'll finally cave and start making games, and if anyone
is interesting in paying for a new Game dev, or a strong fullstack web dev my
email is all over this page \<3

I do also play some video games! Everything from Factorio, to League of
Legends, to WoW and FF14. If you play any of those, are developing for any of
these, feel free to toss me and email!

I also love ttrpgs!! And if people bug me enough I'm working on a variant of <a

href="https://2e.aonprd.com/">pf2e</a>, also I do love talking fun dnd builds
and world building! Along this same vein I also like reading fantasy (Start
reading with Sanderson or Andrew Rowe if you need a recommendation). And if you
have any recommendations for me, you know where to go!

I apparently like emails...
