This project was an exersize in working in larger groups than I had previously.
With our team of 9 engineers we were charged in making a prototype for a leetcode
style social media site. 

My role in this project was almost exclusively devops. I did a small amount of
coding by setting up a structure for an express based api, but the large majority
of this project was setting up the project itself. I hand wrote the webpack file, giving
use the flexibility to use path aliases and simplifying imports. I chose and set up
a jest and react-testing-library based testing environment allowing us to unit
test our components, and I set up a fully automated and gating CI integration
using github actions, ensuring pull requests always passed our predefined standard
before it ever gets a chance to be merged into the main branch.

All of this had to be researched, planned, and communicated to the fairly large
team to help mold and shape those plans to best fit everyones needs. 

Overall this was a fun project with a lot of great engineers, and I am grateful
to have been given to oppurtunity to act as the grease for their gears.
