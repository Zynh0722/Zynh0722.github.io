Z.gg came from a twofold need. The first of the folds was speed. Most similar
applications to zgg are sluggish to use. Z.gg was created with the intent to be
only one thing, and as such it does it well.

All zgg does is provide a combo box to select one of the 100 something champions
in the video game League of Legends, and it will display their ability descriptions
and their cooldowns without ability haste. Z.gg is always up to date, and even
remembers what champion you had up last time you visited!

This is a site I use on a regular basis, and if you just want a simple place
to get overviews of champions without any of the fluff of more complex sites,
feel free to use Z.gg!
