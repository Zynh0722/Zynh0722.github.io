Working on a team of 4 software engineers, this project is a prototype frontend storefront, capable of displaying products, taking user submitted questions and answers, as well as user submitted reviews with dynamic product specific feature ratings.

The main thing this project taught me was how to develop within a team, and how to reduce code duplication across multiple team members. There were a lot of components that needed to be used across multiple features, which required constant team communication, as well as regular meetings regarding style cohesion and progress updates.

While remaining a single page application, the core concepts gained in working on this project has provided the foundation of my CSS skills, and
has given me the confidence to handle CSS like a pro.

If I were to go back to this I would probably make it a multipage app, and make it properly responsive to being rescaled.
