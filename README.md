# Welcome to my blog site!!! 
[![Deploy Astro to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Zynh0722/Zynh0722.github.io/actions/workflows/astro.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Zynh0722/Zynh0722.github.io/actions/workflows/astro.yml)

This is just a fun place for me to put my thoughts and portfolio!

I kept the site simple, shooting for one tagline `brutalist and responsive`

My goal for this site is maximum accessibility and functionality. 

Main tenents include:
 - Layout should function across all devices
 - Meta tags should function, if not be SEO optimized
 - The site will contain minimal javascript, only used for animated visualizations, not for ui or funtionality
 - Using example code live in browser when plausible
 
Enjoy the site, and feel free to email me with feedback at Zynh0722@gmail.com
